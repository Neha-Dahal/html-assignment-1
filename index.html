          To make delicious momos, start by adding one grated onion to the
          minced meat. Then, add half a tablespoon of turmeric powder to give
          the meat a bit of color. Next, add two tablespoons of salt to enhance
          the flavor of the filling. If you want your momos to be spicy, you can
          add a bit more of the two tablespoons of grated chili. Additionally,
          add two tablespoons of ginger and garlic paste each to give the
          filling a tasty flavor. For a sour taste, add half a tablespoon of
          coriander powder to the mixture. After adding the spices, mix them
          well with the meat. To prevent the filling from getting too dry, add
          two tablespoons of vegetable oil and mix it again. Nepalese people
          love their momos with juicy fillings. Lastly, add some finely chopped
          coriander to the mixture and mix it well. With these steps, your momo
          filling will be delicious and flavorful.

        <p>
          Making wrappers is easier than making the fillings or even the cooking
          part and it's fun too! Start by putting the flour into a bowl. To make
          the momo wrappers, start by putting flour into a bowl. Gradually add
          water to the flour, a little at a time, to make dough. Knead the dough
          for a few minutes to make it pliable and easier to use. Once the dough
          is ready, pinch off a bit of it depending on how big you want the
          wrapping to be. Then, take a rolling pin and roll the dough as thinly
          as possible, into circular shapes that are the size of a glass. Be
          sure not to make them too thin or too thick.

        <h2 id="sub-heading-3">3. Cooking the momo</h2>
        <p>
          Now comes the most difficult part: packing and cooking the momos! Take
          a piece of the momo wrapping and put around one tablespoon of filling
          into the center of it. Then, pinch one edge of the wrapping to the
          other edge and twist it. Keep doing this until the filling is fully
          covered and make sure that the wrapping completely covers the filling.
          Otherwise, the momos may break when steamed.
        </p>
        <p>
          After wrapping the momos, oil the bottom of the steamer. This prevents
          the momos from sticking to the steamer. Next, put the momos in the
          steamer in a systematic order so that they don't touch each other.
          Finally, steam the momos for 20-30 minutes, or until they are fully
          cooked. Once cooked, serve the momos hot with some spicy sauce or
          chutney. With these simple steps, you can make delicious and perfectly
          steamed momos at home.
